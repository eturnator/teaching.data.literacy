**Data Management in the Research Environment - Syllabus**

**Instructors**:
Dr. Timothy Norris – Postdoctoral Fellow Miami University Libraries  
Angela Clark – Librarian Associate Professor RSMAS Library

2 Credits: 600 level course

**Texts and Materials:**  
There are no required texts for this course. The readings are either available online or will be made available through the course website.

**Software:**  
We will be using some very basic software packages all of which are open-source (no license fee). You will need to install the following programs on your computer.
* Open refine (previously google refine) - http://openrefine.org/
* Git Bash – see: https://software-carpentry.org/v5/setup.html
* Text editor (choose one) – any OS: Gedit; Windows: Notepad++; Mac: TextWrangler

**Course Description:**  
The purpose of the course is to develop understandings of research data in broader spatial and temporal contexts--known as the research data lifecycle, to introduce several practical tools for digital scholarship, and to encourage early adoption of best practices in research data management. The course will provide students with strategies to increase productivity (efficiency), enable proper data stewardship (security), and help the student exceed data management expectations/requirements in the research environment (compliance). This is a practical course: students are required to produce a data management plan for their specific research endeavor, OR to prepare and deposit data into a discipline specific repository (other projects subject to instructor approval will be considered). The class is open to all graduate students in all disciplines.

**Prerequisites:**  
Students should have a good idea of what their MS/PhD research will be. If no project is identified at time of enrollment admission will be based upon instructor approval.

**Measureable Learning Outcomes:**  
1. Describe data lifecycle models and how they inform data management planning 
2. Identify file formats, data types, data levels and relevant software and understand how they inform data management and preservation.
3. Design best practices for file system organization and file naming conventions to serve sound data storage, backup, and preservation strategies.
4. Gain practical experience in discovering, acquiring, and cleaning data.
5. Produce documentation and metadata for research data to facilitate discovery and re-use.
6. Evaluate legal and ethical implications for data access and sharing strategies.
7. Identify discipline specific or institutional data repositories and prepare data for deposit.

**Methods of Instruction:**  
Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. We expect that students have little or no prior data management experience/training, but students with previous data management experience will also benefit from the course.

**Evaluation of Student Performance:**  
Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:
Homework Assignments	20% / 50 pts.
Class Participation	10% / 25 pts.
Midterm Project	30% / 75 pts.
Final Project	  40% / 100 pts.
Total	100% / 250 pts.

**Assignments;**  
There will be several homework assignments throughout the semester. This will include reading and writing assignments, online tutorial assignments, and data wrangling assignments.

**Class Participation:**  
Engagement in class activities through speaking, contributing comments to the class web-page, or participating in group projects is an important aspect of this class

**Midterm Project:**  
Create a data curation profile of your or your laboratories research. This includes thinking through and responding to your choice of three questions from the data curation profile toolkit (Purdue Universities, see links in schedule below).

**Final Project:**  
Create a data management plan for your research project OR prepare/curate data for deposit into a discipline specific repository.

**Weekly Schedule:**  
All topics/dates/assignments are subject to revision/change based on instructor decisions and any other force majeur that may take place during the quarter.
